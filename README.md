## 🐶 Dog Image Gallery

This project is a dynamic web application that allows users to explore various dog images. Users can either view a collection of 5 random dog images or search for images of a specific dog breed. It provides a quick and engaging way to see different dog breeds.

### ✨ Features of this Project

-   View 5 random dog images.
-   Search for 5 images of a specific dog breed.
-   Real-time fetching and display of images.
-   Basic error handling for invalid breeds or API issues.
-   Clear loading indicators.

-   **HTML5** (Structure)
-   **Tailwind CSS** (Modern Styling & Responsiveness)  
-   **Vanilla JavaScript** (Logic, API Calls, DOM Manipulation)
-   **Dog API** (For Dog Image Data)

### API Workflow

1. Get the free API, API that I used in the project is from [https://dog.ceo/dog-api/](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/). I set up the API in the form so it gives me an array of 5 items as data.

2. Used `fetch` for retrieving the data from the backend of the API, and used Promises to fetch the data.

3. Used fetched data which is nothing but JSON format data, so used `map` to convert array data into single elements and put them inside the HTML content.

4. Used event listeners to get the user instruction and give them their desired output.

5. Also tried handling the errors using `try-catch`, `setTimeout`, etc.
